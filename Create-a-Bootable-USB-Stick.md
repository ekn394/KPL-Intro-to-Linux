# Creating a Bootable USB Flash Drive

<h2> Download Balena Etcher </h2>

Go to https://www.balena.io/etcher/ and click on the green _Download_ button. 

This Etcher program will wipe your SD card and format it so that the computer will read it as a 'bootable' usb.  Note, this will erase whatever was on the USB previously.

After it is done installing the software will look like this.  
The first step is to click on the _"Flash from file"_ button.

Select the operating system you want from one of your previously downloaded .iso or .img files.  In this example, I am choosing Ubuntu-20.04.

Click on the "Flash!" button then sit back and wait for the program to create your bootable usb stick.

This step may take a few minutes.

Congratulations you have created a Linux Boot USB!  That was the easy part.  The hard part is getting your computer to read from a USB stick to get it's boot up instructions.  


## Modifying your BIOS so you can boot from a USB. 
### For Windows 
This will be different for every operating system and even every manufacturer! Even if you are using Windows 10, a Dell laptop will have different options from a Toshiba laptop etc.   It is therefor difficult/and nearly practically impossible for me to have detailed instructions for every possible combination of version of Windows with every possible manufacturers BIOS instructions.  Don't worry though we can give general guidelines that will help to navigate the menus towards the goal.  

**Your mission now is to get to your computer's BIOS screen.**  

These vague instructions on how to get to the BIOS come straight from the Microsoft website: 


_Boot the PC, and press the manufacturerâ€™s key to open the menus. Common keys used: Esc, Delete, F1, F2, F10, F11, or F12._

_Or, if Windows 10 is already installed, from either the Sign on screen or the Start menu, select Power (Power button icon) > hold Shift while selecting Restart. Select Troubleshoot > Advanced options > UEFI Firmware settings._
"

To elaborate on those instructions, it is hard to know what the magic key is for your computer to enter the BIOS menu during startup. So, you might as well try them all.  This might take a few tries.  One try could be to reboot the computer then while it is restarting hitting rapidly F8, F9, F10, F11, F12 over and over until you either end up in the BIOS menu or the attempt failed as you see the Windows log in page. 
    
The other method (for Windows 10), where you hold the Shift key down while you reset the computer easier for sure, if you happen to be using windows 10.  You have to continue holding the reset key down before clicking on reset, and keep holding down the reset button until you get to the new menu. This new menu is not the BIOS menu but it may lead you there if you select "Troubleshoot", then "Advanced Options", then "UEFI Firmware Settings". 

Regarless of which way you chose, if you get to the Windows sign-in screen, that means that the method you tried didn't work, and you will need to reboot and try again.

### At the BIOS Menu

**Your mission now is to make your computer boot from a USB.  

But these instructions will be different for every manufacturer (Dell will be different from Toshiba, etc.) but what we are trying to achieve can be boiled down to a few concepts to look for:  

    -If you see an option to enable Legacy Boot, do it. 
    
    -If you have to choose between Legacy and UEFI, choose Legacy.
    
    -If you see an option to move boot from USB to the top of the Boot order, do it. 
    
    -If you see an option to move Windows Boot Manager to the bottom of the boot order, do it.

Changing the boot order may have options that look like this...

or in rare cases you might see something that looks more like this...

Here is an example after I moved Windows Boot Manager to the bottom of the list. 

<hr>

Save changes and exit.  

Try that out.  Plug in your new Bootable USB (ignoring all warnings about this USB being unreadible) and restart your computer. You shouldn't need any trickery, or need to hold down any buttons anymore.  This may work, or it may not.  You see the difficulty of writing a manual for this. 

If that doesn't work, you might have to go back into your BIOS/Startup menu again and locate another option where you can select between options called either _Legacy_ or _UEFI_.  I have had much more luck using _"Legacy"_.  So if there is an option to enable Legacy, do that.  Or if you have to choose between Legacy or UEFI, choose Legacy.

Here is what this looks like on my computer, but I will show a few other examples to illustrate how this question looks different on different computers.

Above is a screenshot (from a Google image search) where in this case there is an option called _Legacy USB Support_ which has to be enabled.

And in this yet another other way this can be worded where this time is an option called UEFI/BIOS Boot Mode, and you have options to select either UEFI or Legacy.  

As I've mentioned, you will have to look through the options for your particular computer.  

<hr>

As before, Save and Exit the bios.  If you have your Bootable USB stick plugged in, it should boot into that if it is plugged in when the computer restarts.

### For MacOS 

For Macs I found that 50% of the time all you had to do was hold down the 'option' key when you hear the start-up chime noise.  

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12129459/127761118-d275fd02-01a5-4a19-a3f6-bc9ae5536a2a.png)

This would bring you to a 'Startup Menu' where you could select either your harddrive, or your USB-EFI Boot.  If you see two USB-EFI options, try the second one.  I have no explanation, but if there were two, only the second would work for me. 

<hr>

This method worked on exactly half of the test macs that I had access to.  The other 50% of the time you had to do an extra step of rebooting and this time holding Command-R to enter a seperate Utilities menu.  

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12129459/127761047-7170dcbf-3bf7-4765-8268-066acba639d0.png)

From here, none of the of the icon options are helpful. 

<hr>

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12129459/127761052-ffe190a7-955d-45af-b44a-1c5a4257cfb4.png)

Instead, you would have to use the menu at the top of the screen to select Utilities > Startup Security Utility.  

<hr>

Then, you would have to change the two radio buttons to say "No security" - so it wasn't limited to ONLY booting into Official Mac Operating systems, and the button below for "Allow" booting from USB devices.

With those checkboxes in place, the previous instructions of reboot (with the boot USB already plugged in) then holding down the 'option' key when you hear the chime worked just fine.  

## What do I do now?

If everything has gone according to plan so far, then during startup you will be faced with familiar looking Ubuntu installation screens.  This time though you want to select **Try Ubuntu**

Saying again,  This time you want to select **TRY UBUNTU**

Ok, Good luck!.
