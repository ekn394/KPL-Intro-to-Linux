This step may take a few minutes.


## Modifying your BIOS so you can boot from a USB. 

- This will be different for every device and every operating system so it will be difficult/impractical for me to have detailed instructions for every possible version of Windows, for every possible hardware type.  Dell will have a different BIOS screen than a Toshiba which will be different from a Windows Suface, etc.  The BIOS screen will look different on every computer and the menu options are also unique to the manufacturer.   

- Your mission is to get to your computer's BIOS screen.  

These vague instructions come straight from the Microsoft website. 


_Boot the PC, and press the manufacturerâ€™s key to open the menus. Common keys used: Esc, Delete, F1, F2, F10, F11, or F12._

_Or, if Windows 10 is already installed, from either the Sign on screen or the Start menu, select Power (Power button icon) > hold Shift while selecting Restart. Select Troubleshoot > Advanced options > UEFI Firmware settings._
"

To elaborate on those instructions, it is hard to know what the magic key is for your computer to enter the BIOS menu, so you might as well try them all.  This might take a few tries.  A method I have successfully used is to press down the F1 key and then drag your your hand accross the F keys F2, F3, etc up to F11, F12, then turn around and go back and forth until you find yourself in the BIOS menu.  It might not work every time, the window of time that it is looking for the correct key is very short and you might, by bad luck, be at the other end of the keyboard during that fraction of a second, so this might take a few attempts. 
    
The other more civilized method (for Windows 10), where you hold the Shift key down while you reset the computer, you have to continue holding the reset key down while it restarts until you get to a new menu. This new menu is not the BIOS menu but it may lead there through the options "Troubleshoot", then "Advanced Options", then "UEFI Firmware Settings".  

Regarless of which way you chose, if you get to the Windows sign-in screen, the method you tried didn't work, and you should try another one/try again.    


Once you get to your computer's bios screen.  One of the options that you are looking for is the **boot order**.  You want to change the order so that USB is at the top of the list.  

Try that out.  Plug in your new Bootable USB and restart your computer. 

If that doesn't work, you might have to go back into your BIOS/Startup menu again and locate another option where you can select between _Legacy_ or _UEFI_.  I have had much more luck using _"Legacy"_.

To illustrate that this will look different on every computer. Above is a screenshot where in this case there is an option called _Legacy USB Support_ which has to be enabled.

And in this other case there is an option called UEFI/BIOS Boot Mode, and you have options to select either UEFI or Legacy.  

As I've mentioned, you will have to look through the options for your particular computer.  

For Mac, I found that 50% of the time all you had to do was hold down the 'option' key when you heard the startup chime noise.  This would bring you to a 'Startup Menu' where you could select either your harddrive, or your USB-UEFI Boot.  This method worked on half of the test macs that I had access to.  The other 50% of the time you had to do an extra step of rebooting this time holding Command -R to enter a seperate Utilities menue.  From here you would have to use the menu at the top of the screen to select Startup Security Utility.  Then you would have to change the two radio buttons to say "No security" - so it wasn't limited to ONLY booting into Official Mac Operating systems, and the button below for "Allow" booting from USB devices.  With those checkboxes in place, the previous instructions of reboot (with the boot USB already plugged in) then holding down the Option key when you hear the chime worked just fine.
