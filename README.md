Class instructions and starter files for the 4-part series on Intro to Linux

<h3> Virtual Machine </h3>

<br>Virtual machine software will allow us to use a portion of your computer's resources to run a totally separate 'simulated computer' or <em>virtual machine</em>.
This virtual machine can be a totally different operating system too.  For example, you could be using a Windows computer and then run a simulated Linux virtual machine and be able use both at the same time.  A virtual machine is a safe (easy to remove) option for trying out a new operating system.   

Go to https://virtualbox.org/ and download the newest version.  
<br>There should be a HUGE blue 'download' button in the center of your browser window.  
<br>The downloads button will send you to the downloads page, where you have to select your <em>CURRENT</em> operating system.
 
<h3> Installing Virtualbox</h3>

<br>Open up the installer. 
<br> Click Next to begin.
<br> Click Next to use the default install location.
<br> Up to you but I uncheck the box for Quick Launch Bar, then click Next. 
<br> Click Yes. 
<br> Click Next.
<br> Click Finish

<h3> Downloading a Linux Desktop image (.iso)</h3>
For this course we will want Ubuntu 20.04.2.0 LTS which you can find at the top of this page. 
<br>
https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop
  
<br>There are two options, 20.04.2.0 LTS (meaning Long Term Support)
and another download option, version 21.04. We want the earlier one, 20.04.2.0 LTS. 

<br> This will be a LONG download (~3 Gigs of space)


<h3> Setting up your new Linux Virtual Machine</h3>
